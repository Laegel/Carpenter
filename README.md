# Carpenter
Carpenter is a JavaScript framework.

<b>/!\This project is currently in development phase and just partially functional./!\ </b>

This framework has been thought to be as easy to use as possible yet very practical. 


##Modularity
You're not obliged to use every part of the framework : just the ones you really need. It will reduce loading and executing time !

The `Carpenter.use()` function lets you manage which part of the framework you need and loads it.


##MVC
It includes a MVC structure. But, of course, you don't have to use all of them. If you don't need a model, you can still play with controllers and views !

###Views
Views are powered by <a href="http://riotjs.com/">Riot.js</a> but with a custom view parser (not required to use) : Skin.


##Plugins

###Events
You can create your own generic events and reuse it easily on any part of your application with Carpenter's custom event manager.

###Animations
This part is made with <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a>
